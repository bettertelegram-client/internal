Our goal of BetterTelegram is to ensure users Trust, Security & Privacy through using our application. 

With that said, we have decided to provide the source code of BetterTelegram so that users can get a better understanding of what is going on under the hood of the injected DLL.

BetterTelegram is FREE to use, you can simply create a FREE 30-Day trial license on https://bettertelegram.com/account & with that you will be able to use the latest version of our application, along with all the IAT hook/signatures which are associated with the applications functionality. By purchasing a license, you will be able to use future features such as; TOR-ify Telegram (tunneling all inbound/outbound Telegram connections through TOR), TDATA Importer (bypass 2FA/Authentication/Logout when importing TData account files), and more to come!

With this release, you can see the internal functionality of OTR + Ghost Mode + Message Protection features as well as the accounts limit bypass. All those features will remain FREE-of-charge FOREVER!

We hope you enjoy looking through the source code, just as much as we enjoyed writing it!
